 abstract = {Common parallel grippers are limited to closing on an object without the ability for intrinsic in-hand manipulation. Nevertheless, parallel grippers are widely used due to their simplicity and low-cost while relying on extrinsic capabilities for manipulating the object. In this paper, a simple and low-cost mechanism is proposed for augmenting a parallel gripper with intrinsic in-hand manipulation abilities...},
