abstract: Common parallel grippers are limited to closing on an object without the
  ability for intrinsic in-hand manipulation. Nevertheless, parallel grippers are
  widely used due to their simplicity and low-cost while relying on extrinsic capabilities
  for manipulating the object. In this paper, a simple and low-cost mechanism is proposed
  for augmenting a parallel gripper with intrinsic in-hand manipulation abilities...
