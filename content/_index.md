      title: 'ü§ñ My Work in Robotics'
      text: |-
        I‚Äôm a robotics engineer focused on control, manipulation, and planning.  
        I build real-world robotic systems ‚Äî from low-level firmware to ROS 2 task execution pipelines.

        My research and projects focus on:
        - In-hand manipulation and vibration-based grippers
        - ROS 2 control, FOC motor drivers, and embedded systems
        - Planning frameworks for mobile manipulators
        - Real-time controllers and motion planning

        üöÄ I'm always open to collaboration, robotics challenges, or freelance consulting.
