### Role Summary

- 🧠 Designed and implemented the **main control board** for real-time vehicle logic, including throttle control, kill switch logic, and sensor integration.
- 🧮 Applied a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** approach to fine-tune system parameters for optimized vehicle performance on track.
- 🛡️ Developed **safety-critical analog boards** to detect anomalies and ensure driver protection in real-time.
- 🔌 Engineered the full **vehicle wiring system**, including power distribution, signal isolation, and connector strategy.
- 📡 Established robust **CAN bus communication** across distributed embedded boards to minimize wiring complexity and increase modularity.
- 🔧 Integrated **vehicle-wide sensor suite**, including interfacing with a third-party **engine ECU** to read RPM, throttle position, and critical engine data.
- 🛠️ Led **track-side electronic testing and debugging**, implementing on-the-fly fixes and calibration during race simulations.
