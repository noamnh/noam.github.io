[Hugo Blox Builder](https://hugoblox.com) is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience. You can focus on the content and the Hugo Blox Builder which this template is built upon handles the rest.

**Embed videos, podcasts, code, LaTeX math, and even test students!**

On this page, you'll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Hugo Blox.

## Video

Teach your course by sharing videos with your students. Choose from one of the following approaches:

**Youtube**:

    {{</* youtube D2vj0WcvH5c */>}}

{{< youtube D2vj0WcvH5c >}}

**Bilibili**:

    {{</* bilibili BV1WV4y1r7DF */>}}

{{< bilibili BV1WV4y1r7DF >}}

**Video file**

Videos may be added to a page by either placing them in your assets/media/ media library or in your [page's folder](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/), and then embedding them with the _video_ shortcode:

    {{</* video src="my_video.mp4" controls="yes" */>}}




## Inline Images

go
{{</* icon name="python" */>}} Python


renders as

{{< icon name="python" >}} Python
