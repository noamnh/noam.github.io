<!-- [Hugo Blox Builder](https://hugoblox.com) is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience. You can focus on the content and the Hugo Blox Builder which this template is built upon handles the rest.

**Embed videos, podcasts, code, LaTeX math, and even test students!**

On this page, you'll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Hugo Blox. -->



**Video file**

Videos may be added to a page by either placing them in your assets/media/ media library or in your [page's folder](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/), and then embedding them with the _video_ shortcode:

    {{</* video src="my_video.mp4" controls="yes" */>}}




## Inline Images

{{< figure src="/media/racing.jpg" alt="racing" width="600" >}}

go
{{</* icon name="python" */>}} Python


renders as

{{< icon name="python" >}} Python
